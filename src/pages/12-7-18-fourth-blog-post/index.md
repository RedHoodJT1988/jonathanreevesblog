Hello again, welcome to my blog post about working as a team and what it has taught me. For this entire project I have worked with, in my opinion, the best team I have ever had. Each member added something to the table and really made our group well rounded. It has been an adventure these past few weeks. We made every decision as a team. From what tech stack to use all the way to design and functionality. We would have meetings to discuss the overall look and feel of the application. I believe that because of our ability to work as a team and not have any one person throw a fit if their idea wasn't used we were able to create a good looking and functioning app.

Some of the final tasks that were a bit difficult were implementing the markers on the map so when you save the trip the markers stay and are saved to the database. Another task was figuring out the best way to showcase the map while creating your trip. This included: should the map take up the full browser window or only a portion of it, should the map have buttons located on the map screen itself or if the map isn't the full page should it have the buttons on the bottom, side or top of the map.

We've had a few bugs plague and hinder our progress. One such bug is the login feature. For some reason when you click on the Facebook login button and use it to login to our application you are sent to another login page. We remedied this by styling the button with our colors and giving it a custom Facebook logo with a message inside: "Account verified by Facebook, click to continue". After clicking that button you are then able to login to our app. Our home button takes us to the login/signup page and not to the triplist page which is our home page. Getting the Facebook logo on the button was easy. Getting the text to align with the logo and figuring out the best way to size the logo was another challenge all together. I was able to figure out by just playing with sizes of the logo and then using some CSS for aligning the button correctly.

All in all it was a great experience and I would love the opportunity to work with this team again given the chance. The app in my opinion could still use some polishing but let's be honest is any project made by a developer ever actually finished?

Thanks for reading.
