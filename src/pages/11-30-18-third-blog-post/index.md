Project Part I worked on: https://adventure-tracker-frontend.netlify.com/app/

Hello, I am again writing about my experience using React, Apollo, Prisma and GraphQL. This time however I will be talking about working with my team on the project. Working with my team has been great. We problem solve together and then go and solve the problem either on our own or through pair programming. To give an example of this:
I was having an issue with implementing a feature from the Google Maps JavaScript API, more on that frustration later, I wasn't able to get the markers to display their coordinates in an infowindow. I reached out to my teammate Simon Davis. Simon has a really good grasp on React and building the components. He gave me some pointers on what to possibly try and nothing was working. We then decided that we would pair program so I used the Live Share Extension in VS Code to share my code with him and we would both work together coding on what needed to be accomplished. Success. We were able to get the infowindow to properly display the cooridnates when you click on the marker. The steps we used were reading the vanilla JavaScript tutorials by Google and converting that code to React. Not an easy task but thankfully Simon was well versed in React and was able to help me out in struggle. I now have a pretty good idea on converting Vanilla JS to React and we have a pretty awesome feature built into our application.
I believe the above example demonstrates how we were able to work both individually on our project and as a team and get the functionality of the project working as a cohesive unit rather than individual parts.

So as promised I will be talking about the love/hate relationship I have with Google Maps JavaScript API. The API is really great. It has a lot of features that make using a map in your website really awesome and worth figuring out. The documentation on the other hand could probably use an update. Most developers now use a framework. React, Vue, Angular take your pick. The documentation is Vanilla JavaScript. It makes it really hard to get things working in say React when you have to go through a tutorial in JavaScript then convert that tutorial into <INSERT FRAMEWORK HERE>. I'm not saying it can't be done and it is by far no means an excuse for not being able to implement something in a timely manner but it does make it a factor to consider when looking for a map api to use. I had a bit of trouble with it but needless to say I was able to figure it out with the help from my team. I implemented a feature that allows a user to place markers on the map to make a custom trip. The markers are labeled from 'A' to 'Z'. That's all for now.

Thanks for reading.
